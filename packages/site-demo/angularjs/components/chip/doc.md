# Chip

**Chips display distinct inputs, attributes, or actions.**
Use chips to display choices, as inputs or to filter content.

## Default

Use default to display distinct attributes such as tags on a blog post.

<demo-block component="chip" partial="default"></demo-block>

## Dismissible

Use dismissible when chips can be removed by users.

<demo-block component="chip" partial="dismissible"></demo-block>

## Choice

Use choice when users makes an exclusive choice between values. When space is not a constraint, use this chip instead of a select component.

<demo-block component="chip" partial="choice"></demo-block>

## Filter

Use Filter as an entry point to one or several choices. When it is active, it can have a clear button.

<demo-block component="chip" partial="filter"></demo-block>

## Small

Use small when space is a constraint, as in areas like text fields, selects, dropdown menus and metadata.

<demo-block component="chip" partial="small"></demo-block>
