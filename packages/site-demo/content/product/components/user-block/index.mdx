# User block

**User blocks display user info.**

## Sizes

User blocks come in three sizes: _small_, _medium_, and _large_.

### Small

<DemoBlock2 demo="size-s" engine={props.engine} withThemeSwitcher />

### Medium

<DemoBlock2 demo="size-m" engine={props.engine} withThemeSwitcher />

### Large

<DemoBlock2 demo="size-l" engine={props.engine} withThemeSwitcher />

## Layouts

There are two alternative layouts: _vertical_ and _extended_.

### Vertical

A _large_ size user block can be displayed vertically.

<DemoBlock2 demo="vertical" engine={props.engine} withThemeSwitcher />

### Extended

The extended layout displays additional contact actions and a follow button.
When there are more than five contact actions, the fifth is replaced with an overflow menu presenting remaining actions.

<DemoBlock2 demo="extended" engine={props.engine} withThemeSwitcher />

### Properties

<PropTable component="UserBlock" />
