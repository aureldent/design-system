# Button

**Buttons trigger actions with a single click.**

## High emphasis

Use high emphasis to help users to identify the main action.
There should not be more than one high emphasis button in a view.

<DemoBlock demo="emphasis-high" engine={props.engine} withThemeSwitcher />

## Medium emphasis

Use medium emphasis for secondary actions.

<DemoBlock demo="emphasis-medium" engine={props.engine} withThemeSwitcher />

## Low emphasis

When the view contains a primary and a medium button, use low emphasis for lower priority actions.
Alternatively, use low emphasis when there is only one level of priority.

<DemoBlock demo="emphasis-low" engine={props.engine} withThemeSwitcher />

## Small size

Use small size when space is a constraint.

<DemoBlock demo="small" engine={props.engine} withThemeSwitcher />
